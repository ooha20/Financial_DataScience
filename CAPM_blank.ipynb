    "First, we run the CAPM analysis for `Apple` and it turns out that Apple is more volatile than the S&P-500 as we have a beta coefficient of 1.3873. This estimated beta coefficient is statistically significant at 1% level since we have a p-value of 0.0000). However, the intercept term is not statistically significant. Therefore, interpretation of the intercept term, which indicates the performance of the technical analysis, does not make sense."

    "When it comes to `Intel`, the result is quite similar in terms of slope coefficien $\\beta$ and intercept term. The beta coefficient of 1.4777 implies that there is a correlation between excess market return and excess return of the Intel. More specifically, 1-unit increase in S&P-500 leads to an increase in IBM return by nearly 1.4777 The result also suggests that the Intel is more risky than market index.  Again, the intercept term is not statistically significant at conventional confidence interval."

Conversely, the assets lie below the SML are overvalued because it return of this stock is lower for a given amount of risk."
